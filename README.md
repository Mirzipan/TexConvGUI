# TexConvGUI
Simple GUI window for a more comfortable usage of texconv utility, inspired by [convert-to-dds-util](https://github.com/frkn/convert-to-dds-util)

## Requirements
This tool needs texconv.exe in the same directory to run. You can either use the included version, or download a newer one from [DirectXTex](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases).
